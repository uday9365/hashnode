# What is Hacktoberfest? ü§î

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source projects where open-source developers from all over the world contribute to repositories through pull requests (PRs). It happens every year in the month of October. Open-source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests on GitHub. Hacktoberfest was first launched in 2013.

# How to get started?üôÑ

1. Create a GitHub or GitLab account, if you don't already have one.
2. Register for Hacktoberfest: [Hacktoberfest registration page](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth/) and follow the instruction carefully and then sign in with your GitHub id (between September 26 to October 31).
3. Find projects which are suitable for you to contribute on the GitHub page. You can use repo tags like `label: hacktoberfest` `is: issue` `is: open`

# Creating your first Pull Request (PR)

In order to create your first PR, you must be familiar with the version control system eg. Git and GitHub.

**Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.**

If you‚Äôre not very familiar with Git & GitHub, please check this [Video](https://youtu.be/apGV9Kg7ics)

  - Fork the repository
  - Clone the repository
  - Create a branch
  - Commit the changes you‚Äôve made
  - Push changes to the GitHub branch you‚Äôve created
  - Create Pull Request
  - Now that you‚Äôve created your Pull Request, wait till it gets merged. ü§©

Please note that only a merged PR will be counted as a contribution toward Hactoberfest.

# Meaningful Pull Requests (PRs)üòÑ

At first, you may feel very limited with what you can actually contribute to open-source. But that's totally fine, there are plenty of ways for newbies to contribute, including no-code and low-code options. What's important is that you don't end up **spamming** maintainers with junk pull requests.

# Rules and regulationsüòê

- PRs can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
- The PRs must contain commits you made yourself.
- If a maintainer reports your pull requests as **spam** or **invalid**, it will not be counted towards your participation in Hacktoberfest.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that‚Äôs not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
